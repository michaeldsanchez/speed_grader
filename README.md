## Usage
It will be necessary to ensure that the `ant` program is running correctly on your computer, if you are using Netbeans
you can find the path to your ant bin through the IDEs Java preferences. (System should have a path to ant home by
default)

After selecting number of test inputs and iterations, the generate button will create text fields to enter test inputs.

By checking the "User Input" box, you can specify that the student projects will take user input instead of using CLA.

## TODO
adding input redirection to take user input instead of CLA and writing output from program executions to a txt file.
